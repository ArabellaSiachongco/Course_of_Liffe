          I've transformed my life, and I believe you can do the same.

        <div class="intro p2">
          I used to find solace in manhua, feeling purposeless while others
          pursued dreams. Battling moments of depression, I decided to break the
          cycle. Embracing positivity became my mantra, and I've found joy in
          letting the waves of life decide my future. Life is a journey, and
          every day offers new opportunities for growth and happiness. With
          perseverance, anyone can find their way to a brighter tomorrow.

          In 2022, I enrolled at the University of the Cordilleras for the Bachelor of Science in Web Technology track. I chose this course because I find joy in coding, and I am not joking when I say I truly enjoy it. Learning through YouTube tutorials has been a great experience. 
        </div>
        <div class="text1">
          However, I was somewhat disappointed because basic HTML and CSS wasn't taught in the first year, it just started this second year and the teacher made us learn through free code camp. After three months, I managed to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        </div>
        <div class="text1">
          I still consider myself a novice, and my learning process mainly involves relying on YouTube tutorials where I often end up copying codes and making minor modifications such as changing colors. Unfortunately, procrastination has been a consistent challenge for me.
